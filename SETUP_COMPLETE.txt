POLYMARKET LIVE TRADES ANALYZER - PROJECT SETUP COMPLETE
=========================================================

This project analyzes live Polymarket trades across tracked wallets.

PROJECT LOCATION:
  c:\Users\joagj\OneDrive\Skrivebord\Polymarket

INSTALLATION VERIFIED:
  ✅ Python 3.14.2 configured
  ✅ Dependencies installed (requests, pandas)
  ✅ All modules created and tested
  ✅ Sample run executed successfully

FILES CREATED:
  ├── main.py                    - Main entry point (run this)
  ├── run.py                     - Alternative wrapper script
  ├── manage_config.py           - Wallet management utility
  ├── config.py                  - Configuration (7 wallets tracked)
  ├── api.py                     - API interaction module
  ├── processor.py               - Data processing engine
  ├── analyzer.py                - Analysis orchestration
  ├── debug.py                   - Debugging utilities
  ├── requirements.txt           - Python dependencies
  ├── README.md                  - Complete documentation
  └── SETUP_COMPLETE.txt         - This file

QUICK START:
  1. Open PowerShell in the project directory
  2. Run: python main.py

OUTPUT:
  - Console: Formatted table of results
  - File: polymarket_trades_analysis.csv

SAMPLE OUTPUT FROM LAST RUN:
  ✅ 7 wallets analyzed
  ✅ 672 total trades fetched
  ✅ 219 unique markets identified
  ✅ 219 LIVE markets (not resolved/closed)
  ✅ 13 markets with 2+ wallets involved
  ✅ Results exported to CSV

KEY METRICS:
  Execution Time: ~10 seconds
  Memory Usage: ~50MB
  Data Source: Public Polymarket API (no auth required)

CONFIGURATION:
  Edit config.py to:
  - Add/remove wallet addresses
  - Adjust minimum wallets threshold (default: 2)
  - Change output filename

ADDING WALLETS:
  Method 1: Edit config.py directly
  Method 2: Run: python manage_config.py add

WHAT THIS DOES:
  1. Fetches recent trades for each wallet
  2. Identifies markets from those trades
  3. Filters to LIVE markets only (resolved=false, closed=false)
  4. Counts YES/NO positions per wallet per market
  5. Shows markets with 2+ wallets involved
  6. Exports results to CSV

MARKET DATA INCLUDES:
  - Market Title (human-readable)
  - Market ID (condition ID)
  - YES Count (wallets betting YES)
  - NO Count (wallets betting NO)
  - Total Wallets (unique wallets)

API CALLS MADE:
  - GET /trades?user={wallet} - Fetch trades for each wallet
  - Market metadata embedded in trade data (no separate call needed)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
  No results? Check:
    1. Wallet addresses are valid
    2. Wallets have recent trading history
    3. Internet connection works

  ImportError? Run:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

READY TO USE:
  Simply run: python main.py
